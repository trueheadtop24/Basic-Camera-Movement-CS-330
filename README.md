# 4-2_Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to add commented modern OpenGL code that allows for panning, zooming, and orbiting a 3D scene. Use the keyboard, mouse, and movement combinations below:

WASD keys should be used to control the forward (zoom in), backward (zoom out), left, and (pan) right motion.
QE keys should be used to control the upward and downward movement.
Mouse cursor should be used to change the orientation of the camera so it can look up and down or right and left.
Mouse scroll should be used to adjust the speed of the movement or the speed at which the camera travels around the scene.
Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Create code to address the required functionality. The work you complete in the project source code must meet the required functionality and visual representation outlined for this assignment. This result may require multiple attempts and programming strategies to get it right, but that is okay! Working in stages is an important part of any coding project.
Apply logic and proper syntax to code. Source code should be free of logical or syntax errors that prevent the application from running as expected. You will be given credit for code that is set up to meet specifications or solve the problem.
Apply commenting and formatting standards to facilitate understanding of the code. All code should be well commented. Commenting is a practiced art. Your comments should be as clear and brief as possible. Your comments should explain the purpose of lines or sections of the code and may also include how you achieved a specific task in the code. Be sure to document any sections of code that produce errors or incorrect results. Organize all code to meet formatting standards.
